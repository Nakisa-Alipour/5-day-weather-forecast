# 5 Day Weather Forecast

## Description
The Weather Dashboard is a web application that allows users to search for weather information for multiple cities. The application features a dynamic user interface that displays current and future weather conditions for the selected city. Users can also view a 5-day forecast for the selected city, as well as access a search history that allows them to easily view weather information for previously searched cities.

The Weather Dashboard utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for cities. It stores persistent data using localStorage.
